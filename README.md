# Black Lives Matter
We take our website offline as a small mark of respect, and expression of solidarity.

## Getting started

This website is built simply using plain HTML and CSS (using tailwind). You can copy this website and adjust it.

The CSS file only contains classes that are used in the HTML. If you make any edits and you use additional classes from tailwind, simply run:
```
npx tailwindcss build styles.css -o output.css
```
